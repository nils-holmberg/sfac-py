"imdb-72"	0	"Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  "

"imdb-621"	1	"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  "
"imdb-622"	1	"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).

"imdb-633"	1	"I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  "
"imdb-634"	0	"I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  "
"imdb-635"	0	"He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  "
"imdb-636"	1	"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  "
"imdb-637"	1	"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  "

"imdb-760"	0	"This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  "
"imdb-761"	1	"Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  "

"imdb-786"	1	"I loved it, it was really scary.  "

"imdb-790"	1	"This is an extraordinary film.  "
"imdb-791"	1	"As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  "
"imdb-792"	1	"This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  "
"imdb-793"	1	"The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  "
"imdb-794"	1	"This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  "

"imdb-802"	0	"Avoid at ALL costs!  "
"imdb-803"	0	"Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  "
"imdb-804"	0	"The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  "
"imdb-805"	0	"The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  "
"imdb-806"	0	"The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  "
"imdb-807"	0	"The worst one of the series.  "
"imdb-808"	1	"Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  "
"imdb-809"	1	"When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  "
"imdb-810"	1	"Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  "
"imdb-811"	1	"Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  "
"imdb-812"	1	"This film offers many delights and surprises.  "
"imdb-813"	1	"When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from \"Don Giovanni\" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  "
"imdb-814"	1	"The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  "
"imdb-815"	1	"You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  "
"imdb-816"	1	"But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  "
"imdb-817"	1	"The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  "
"imdb-818"	1	"You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  "
"imdb-819"	1	"The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  "
"imdb-820"	1	"The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  "
"imdb-821"	1	"Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  "
"imdb-822"	1	"Conclusion - I loved it.  "
"imdb-823"	1	"It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  "
"imdb-824"	1	"I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  "
"imdb-825"	1	"Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  "
"imdb-826"	1	"It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  "
"imdb-827"	1	"The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  "
"imdb-828"	1	"Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  "
"imdb-829"	1	"Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  "

"imdb-836"	0	"It's very slow.  "

"imdb-845"	1	"\" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  "

"imdb-853"	0	"The acting is beyond abysmal.  "
"imdb-854"	0	"Everything stinks.  "
"imdb-855"	0	"Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  "
"imdb-856"	0	"Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  "

"imdb-858"	0	"In short, don't bother with this movie.  "
"imdb-859"	1	"I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  "
"imdb-860"	1	"The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  "
"imdb-861"	1	"If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  "
"imdb-862"	1	"The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  "
"imdb-863"	1	"A film not easily forgotten.  "
"imdb-864"	1	"But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  "
"imdb-865"	1	"The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  "
"imdb-866"	1	"The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  "
"imdb-867"	1	"Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  "
"imdb-868"	1	"Great movie!  "
"imdb-869"	0	"Also the story and acting were weak.  "
"imdb-870"	0	"At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  "
